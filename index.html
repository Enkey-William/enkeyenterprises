        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <div class="introFlex">
            <p>The purpose of this page is to be a map that links to a detailed portfolio. The links lead to different pages that provide a snippet of code as an example of concepts learned. The snippets show the ability to accomplish different tasks in the specified languages. The simplest way I've found to allow the code to make sense is to walk through a scenario that would require it.</p>
            <p>There are Oracle and Microsoft SQL examples are of a simple video store model. There are also some T-SQL examples of a <q>restaurantdb</q> model. There are ERDs for both database examples.</p>
            <p>The pages may not be terribly fancy, but it is all work done myself.</p>
            <!--
            <p>The idea is to have a setting where a 'Ma and Pa' store sells meal items. Primarily it will open as a sort of burger joint. After 
            several months of incredibly successful growth the need to expand the premises and to obtain secondary and tertiary locations becomes apparent. The owner quickly has to go from a relatively static mode of business to needing to be more dynamic.</p>
            <p>Whether small businesses realize it or not, they start out with the need of a database. Many try to implement this in the form of 
            a spreadsheet; in my opinion not the best option. However, this entrepreneur was smart and connected; he knew a college student who could try to build everything from the ground up at a relatively low cost.</p>
            <p>Business rules dictate the organization of its programs. After several extensive interviews between the student and business 
            owner the student believes he knows what is needed and how to implement it. It breaks down into three basic operations: a database to store information for the business, a desktop application for the owner to manage his business, and a mobile application so the owner can be mobile and effective at the same time.</p>
            <p>The initial set up went well, but when the business needed to expand the student realized that the nature of the operating 
            systems became important. To better ensure cross-site performance he needed to mold the environment to ensure maximum efficiency. Unfortunate for him, the owner allowed the individual sites to choose their own technology systems.</p> -->
