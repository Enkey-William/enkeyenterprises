            <p>This lab was some involved INSERT statements. Oracle SQL only allows one row to be added at a time when using the VALUES clause; however, a SELECT statement can be used to insert millions of rows at a time. Below is an example of one of the SELECT statements I built. I'll show more in lab 11, where a more sensible MERGE statement is used to add data.<pre><code>
            SELECT DISTINCT r.rental_id AS rental_id
             ,                c.contact_id AS customer_id
             ,                TRUNC(tu.check_out_date) AS check_out_date
             ,                TRUNC(tu.return_date) AS return_date
             ,                1 AS created_by
             ,                SYSDATE AS creation_date
             ,                1 AS last_updated_by
             ,                SYSDATE AS last_update_date
              FROM contact c INNER JOIN member m
                ON c.member_id = m.member_id INNER JOIN transaction_upload tu
                ON m.account_number = tu.account_number
               AND c.first_name = tu.first_name
               AND NVL(c.middle_name, 'x') = NVL(tu.middle_name, 'x')
               AND c.last_name = tu.last_name LEFT JOIN rental r
                ON c.contact_id = r.customer_id 
               AND TRUNC(tu.check_out_date) = TRUNC(r.check_out_date)
               AND TRUNC(tu.return_date) = TRUNC(r.return_date);
            </code></pre></p>
