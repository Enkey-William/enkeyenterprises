            <p>Below are some scripts for backup and recovery purposes. No database is complete without a recovery plan!<br>Automating something like this can be a bit tricky. I'd say the simplest approach would be to create a library in PowerShell and cmdlets that can approach this task for you. It's quite involved, and not shown here.<pre><code>

            ALTER DATABASE studentdb SET RECOVERY FULL;
